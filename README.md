# project-basket
This project is a simple site where you can view and add basketball players to a file.

In the landing page (index.html), you'll find 3 buttons:
- `View players`&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll show all players data in table format.
- `View players by height`&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll prompt for the height and it'll show players by that height in table format.
- `Add a player`&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll prompt for player data and it'll add that player if he isn't saved in the file.
